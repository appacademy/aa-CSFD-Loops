### Automated Testing

When you click Test > Run all Tests, you are telling your IDE to find and run all of the automated tests associated with the project.

Automated testing is a valuable tool for keeping bugs out of your code. Briefly, they are a way of codifying the expectation that given a certain input, the program will produce an expected output. We will dive into how they work (and how to write your own!) later in the course, but for now they're a useful way of letting you get immediate feedback on whether or not you've correctly completed the exercises below.

### Repeat Number

Given a number 1-9, return a string with repeating with that number.

### Roman Numeral
